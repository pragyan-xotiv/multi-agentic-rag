# Rule: Task Documentation via Cursor Tasks

## Purpose
Ensure all new features and bug fixes are tracked using structured task files, while enforcing code quality and consistency.

## Instructions

When documenting a new feature, bug fix, or technical change:

1. **Do not modify any code directly** during this task creation phase.
2. **Create a new markdown file** in the `@cursor-tasks` folder.
3. **Name the file** as `Task-<next_number>.md`, where `<next_number>` is the next number after the highest existing task file (e.g., if the last file is `Task-4.md`, the new one should be `Task-5.md`).
4. Follow the structure defined in `@STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_TASK.md` for documenting the task.
5. Stay **strictly within the provided context** (e.g., relevant SQL file or module).
6. Ensure that the described steps **do not break any existing functionality**.
7. When the task is later implemented in code, the solution must follow **modern best coding practices**, including:
   - Code clarity and maintainability
   - Proper error handling
   - Adherence to existing project architecture and standards
   - Minimal side effects and good modular design

## Applies To
- Feature requests  
- Bug reports  
- Technical enhancements  
- Refactoring tasks
