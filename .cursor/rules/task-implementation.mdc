# Task-Based Implementation Workflow

## Purpose
Every implementation must be based on an approved task file located in `@cursor-tasks/`.

## Implementation Instructions
- Use the task file (e.g., `@cursor-tasks/Task-2.md`) as the single source of truth.
- Only modify code relevant to the described task scope.
- Avoid unrelated file edits.
- Follow coding best practices.
- Write clean, modular code.
- Add necessary unit/integration tests.
- Do not break existing functionality.

## Cursor Execution
- Extract file paths, interfaces, and logic only from the task file.
- Use the task filename to guide implementation.
- Reject implementation if task file is missing or unclear.
