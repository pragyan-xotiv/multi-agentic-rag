- **Integration testing**: For agent interactions with TestContainers
- **E2E testing**: With Playwright for UI workflows
- **LLM evaluation harness**: For testing and evaluating agent outputs
- **Regression testing**: To prevent previously fixed issues from recurring

### Security Measures
- **Input validation**: Sanitization of all user inputs
- **Rate limiting**: To prevent abuse of the system
- **Content filtering**: For scraper outputs to ensure safety
- **Dependency scanning**: Automated vulnerability checks
- **Encryption**: For sensitive data at rest and in transit

### Scalability Components
- **Queue management system**: For handling high volumes of scraping and processing tasks
- **Horizontal scaling**: For the agent execution environment
- **Redis cache**: For sharing state between distributed components

## Agents

### Intelligent Scraper Agent

The Scraper Agent makes dynamic decisions about what content to extract from websites, optimizing for value and relevance.

**Key Features:**
- Analyzes pages for information density and relevance
- Evaluates outgoing links to determine optimal navigation paths
- Maintains a priority queue of URLs based on expected value
- Intelligently extracts content based on page structure and content type
- Avoids low-value pages and duplicated information

### Knowledge Processing Agent

The Knowledge Processing Agent transforms raw web content into structured, interconnected knowledge using content-adaptive processing.

**Key Features:**
- Analyzes content type and characteristics to determine optimal processing strategies
- Intelligently extracts domain-specific entities and relationships
- Discovers relationships between concepts to build a knowledge graph
- Applies content-appropriate chunking and embedding strategies
- Validates the quality and integration of extracted knowledge

### Query Agent

The Query Agent translates natural language questions into effective knowledge base queries by understanding semantic intent.

**Key Features:**
- Analyzes query intent and complexity
- Decomposes complex queries into logical sub-questions with dependencies
- Plans optimal retrieval strategies for each query component
- Synthesizes comprehensive answers from multiple sources
- Provides citations and evaluates answer completeness

### Retrieval Agent

The Retrieval Agent employs multiple search methods simultaneously to find the most relevant information in the knowledge base.

**Key Features:**
- Dynamically selects and combines vector search, keyword matching, entity retrieval, and graph traversal
- Executes retrieval strategies in parallel for maximum effectiveness
- Intelligently ranks and merges results from different methods
- Evaluates information completeness and relevance
- Returns comprehensive result packages including text, entities, and relationships

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate through structured JSON messages passed via a message bus architecture, ensuring loose coupling and flexibility. Each agent exposes a well-defined API that accepts specific request formats and returns standardized responses.

Communication is implemented using LangGraph's state management and channel system, with each agent built as a LangGraph workflow with well-defined input and output states.

## Implementation

Each agent is implemented as a LangGraph workflow with:

- Comprehensive state tracking
- Specialized nodes for different processing stages
- Conditional execution paths based on intelligent analysis
- Asynchronous processing capabilities
- Integration with vector stores, knowledge graphs, and other storage systems
