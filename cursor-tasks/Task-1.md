## 🧩 Fix Non-Recursive Scraper Workflow Premature Termination

---

## 🎯 Objective
Fix the non-recursive scraper workflow implementation that is prematurely terminating before processing any URLs. Currently, the workflow initializes correctly but terminates after selecting the first URL without fetching or processing any content.

---

## 🔧 Steps to Implement

1. Modify the `processNextUrl` function in `src/lib/agents/scraper-new/workflow.ts` to only set `state.finalOutput` when actually done (empty queue or max pages reached).

2. Remove the premature setting of `state.finalOutput` in the `processNextUrl` function's main execution path when a URL is selected.

3. Ensure that the workflow's conditional edge from "processNextUrl" properly directs to "fetchPage" when there are URLs to process.

4. Add additional debug logging to track the workflow execution path to verify the fix.

5. Update the state management to ensure state transitions are properly processed.

6. Validate that the workflow can successfully fetch and process at least one page before terminating.

---

## 🧪 Validation Criteria

- The workflow successfully fetches at least the initial URL.
- The page content is properly extracted and processed.
- The logs show the complete workflow path: processNextUrl → fetchPage → detectAuthentication → extractContent → discoverLinks → queueManager → processNextUrl.
- The final output contains at least one processed page.
- The scraper terminates only when it has either:
  - Processed all URLs in the queue
  - Reached the maximum page limit
  - Encountered an unrecoverable error

## 📝 Notes

This is a critical fix for the non-recursive scraper implementation which was created to solve recursion depth issues in the original scraper. The current implementation has correct workflow logic but state management issues are preventing it from executing the complete workflow path.

The key issue is in how the workflow handles state transitions between nodes. We need to ensure that state updates don't inadvertently cause the workflow to terminate prematurely.

LangGraph's StateGraph pattern is being used correctly in the overall design, but the implementation details around state transitions need refinement.
