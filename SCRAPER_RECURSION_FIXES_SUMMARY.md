# Scraper Recursion Fixes Summary

## Implemented Fixes

We've implemented several critical fixes to address the recursion limit issues in the scraper workflow:

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added detailed state logging when approaching recursion limit
- Shows current URL, queue size, visited URLs count, and extracted content size

### 2. Forced Termination Fallback
- Added aggressive termination condition at 15 decision cycles 
- Prevents hitting the recursion limit of 25
- Returns current results instead of failing

### 3. Improved URL Queue Processing
- Enhanced URL marking in `decideNextAction`
- Added normalized URL handling when `preventDuplicateUrls` is enabled
- Improved logging of visited URLs

### 4. Adjusted Configuration Settings
- Lowered `recursionLimit` from 100 to 30 for testing
- Lowered `maxIterations` from 50 to 20 for testing
- Reduced max execution time from 10 minutes to 3 minutes
- Added explicit logging of configuration settings

### 5. Enhanced URL Discovery Filtering
- Added filtering for URLs with similar paths
- Added filtering for URLs with low predicted value (< 0.2)
- Maintained existing pattern-based filtering

## Remaining Tasks

To fully implement all the fixes from the SCRAPER_RECURSION_ISSUES.md file, the following tasks remain:

### 1. Fix Linter Errors
- There are several TypeScript linter errors that need to be addressed
- Mostly related to possibly undefined values and method existence checks

### 2. Complete Circuit Breaker Implementation
- Finish implementing the circuit breaker in the page processor
- Force termination when page count reaches max pages

### 3. Verify LangGraph Library Version
- Check current version of @langchain/langgraph
- Update to latest if needed

### 4. Test Progressive Implementation
- Test with simple static sites (1-5 pages)
- Test with medium complexity sites (10-20 pages)
- Document results at each stage

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the scraper with the current implementation on a small, simple website
2. Monitor logs for the enhanced debug information
3. Verify that the scraper completes without hitting recursion limits
4. Check that the forced termination works as expected if needed

## Next Steps

If the scraper still exhibits recursion issues after these changes:

1. Consider implementing a pagination approach to scrape in batches
2. Review the detailed execution path logs to identify potential cycles
3. Add more aggressive termination conditions in specific edge cases
4. Consider simplifying the workflow graph structure
