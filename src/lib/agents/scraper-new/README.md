# Non-Recursive Scraper Agent

This is an improved implementation of the Scraper Agent that uses a simplified LangGraph workflow to avoid recursion issues while maintaining all the core functionality of the original implementation.

## Key Improvements

- **Simplified Workflow**: Linear graph structure with clear termination conditions
- **No Recursion**: Avoids hitting LangGraph's recursion limits
- **Same API**: Maintains the same interface as the original scraper agent
- **Better Debugging**: Clearer execution path and improved logging
- **Same Features**: Still supports all features including authentication (simplified), content extraction, and link discovery

## Workflow Structure

The scraper workflow is designed as a simplified LangGraph workflow with the following nodes:

1. **processNextUrl**: Selects the next URL from the queue or terminates if done
2. **fetchPage**: Fetches the page content for the current URL
3. **detectAuthentication**: Checks if authentication is required
4. **handleAuthentication**: Simplified authentication handling
5. **extractContent**: Extracts content from the page
6. **discoverLinks**: Identifies and prioritizes links on the page
7. **queueManager**: Adds new links to the queue and checks termination conditions

The workflow has a clear loop structure with a single conditional edge for termination:

```
START → processNextUrl → [conditional] → fetchPage → detectAuthentication → [conditional] →
                                       ↗                                                    ↘
                         queueManager ←                                       extractContent → discoverLinks
```

## Usage

The usage is identical to the original scraper agent:

```typescript
import { ScraperAgent } from '@/lib/agents/scraper-new';

const scraper = new ScraperAgent();

// Basic usage
const result = await scraper.scrape({
  baseUrl: 'https://example.com',
  scrapingGoal: 'Extract information about widgets',
  maxPages: 10,
  maxDepth: 3
});

// Streaming usage
await scraper.streamScraping({
  baseUrl: 'https://example.com',
  scrapingGoal: 'Extract information about widgets',
  maxPages: 10
}, async (event) => {
  // Process events in real-time
  console.log(`Event: ${event.type}`);
});
```

## Integration with Controller

This implementation maintains the same API as the original scraper agent, making it a drop-in replacement for the controller integration.

## Future Enhancements

- Enhanced authentication handling
- More sophisticated link prioritization
- Better content deduplication
- Integration with rate limiting and proxy support
