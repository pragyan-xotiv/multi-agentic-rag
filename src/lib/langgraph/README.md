# LangGraph Integration

This directory contains the LangGraph workflow implementation for the multi-agentic RAG system.

## Purpose

LangGraph extends LangChain to provide structured agent workflows with:

- Sequential multi-step reasoning
- State management for complex workflows
- Tool utilization for enhanced capabilities
- Better control over the agent's thought process

## Implementation

Our implementation includes:

- `simple-workflow.ts`: A streamlined workflow that simulates a multi-step agent without direct LangGraph dependencies
- Two-stage reasoning process (thinking then answering)
- Handling of LLM responses with robust error management

## How It Works

The workflow follows these steps:

1. **Question Analysis**: The agent first thinks about the question, breaking it down and considering how to approach it
2. **Answer Generation**: Using the thoughts from the first step, the agent generates a comprehensive answer

This approach provides several benefits:

- More thoughtful and thorough responses
- Better handling of complex questions
- Ability to show the reasoning process when needed
- Reduced hallucination through structured thinking

## Future Extensions

The current implementation can be extended to:

- Add more specialized agent types
- Incorporate memory and context management
- Integrate with vectorstore for retrieval-augmented generation
- Support multi-agent collaboration with different roles
